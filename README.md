# Image-Denoising-and-Image-Quality-Assessment
This Project is to study the output image quality of different filters after denoising. Both(1)spatial filtering (linear & non-linear) and (2) frequency domain filtering (ILPF, BLPF, GLPF & IHPF, BHPF, Laplacian) are applied and output images quality (IQ) assessment was done using metrics like MSE, PSNR, SSIM, CNR, and MTF. 

1. Spatial Filtering 
Filters tested here are box filters (6x6, 4x4 kernals) and Ganssian filters(5x5 , 11x11 kernals)
