# Image-Denoising-and-Image-Quality-Assessment
This Project is to study the output image quality of different filters after denoising. Both(1)frequency domain filtering (ILPF, BLPF, GLPF & IHPF, BHPF, Laplacian) and (2)spatial filtering (linear & non-linear) are applied and output images quality (IQ) assessment was done using metrics like MSE, PSNR, SSIM, CNR, and MTF.
